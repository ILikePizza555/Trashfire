Code to experiment with a HW problem.

```
Consider a binary search tree where keys are positive integers. Augment the tree to answer Range queries of the form:  “how many elements have key in the range [a, b]”?  Thus, such a query is called by the function Range(a, b).

Provide pseudocode for Insert, Delete, and Range queries.  Provide a run-
ning  time  analysis  for  all  these  queries,  in  terms  on n(the  number  of nodes in the tree) and D (the maximum depth).  (Hint:  you might want to maintain subtree sizes at the nodes.)
